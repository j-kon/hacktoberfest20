My pull request was labeled as invalid by a maintainer, why doesn’t it count?
If a repository maintainer decides a pull request you made was spammy or an unhelpful contribution to the project, they can add an invalid or spam label to your PR. This lets us know they do not think your pull request is a quality contribution, so it will not count toward Hacktoberfest.

Why is my pull request in a maturing state on my profile?
In an effort to reduce spam and help maintainers, we’ve introduced a two week review period for all pull requests. Once you have submitted an eligible pull request (ready for review, not draft), the fourteen-day review window begins. This period gives maintainers time to identify and label any spammy pull requests as invalid. If your pull request is not marked invalid during that window, it will contribute toward the four you need to complete the Hacktoberfest challenge. If during this period your pull request is labeled as invalid, you will need to submit another eligible pull request (or resolve the issue with the current pull request), at which point the review period will start again.

How do I get started?
First, register at hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com. Then, submit at least four pull requests to any public GitHub repository that is classified with the hacktoberfest topic or has a hacktoberfest-accepted label on it. You can look for open issues labeled Hacktoberfest for inspiration. Quality contributions are encouraged! Are you maintaining a repo? Create issues or classify existing issues on your GitHub projects with hacktoberfest to help let new contributors know what to work on. Tag any spam or irrelevant pull requests with the invalid label to disqualify them.

What do I do if I want to contribute to a project but it doesn’t have the hacktoberfest topic?
You can still contribute to any public GitHub repository and have it count towards your progress provided that your pull request is labeled with hacktoberfest-accepted.

If I made 4 pull requests before October 3rd, 2020 and they were merged, will they count towards my goal?
All pull requests made before October 3 at 12:00 UTC, 2020, will count before the rules were changed. Please keep in mind that the review window has been updated to 14 days.

How do I track my progress?
Log in with your GitHub account at hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com to check your progress and stats.

I completed four pull requests. When will I receive my T-shirt?
T-shirts (or the option to plant a tree) will be awarded on a first-come, first-serve basis to the first 70,000 participants who successfully complete the Hacktoberfest challenge. We’ll start sending out emails with more details on redeeming T-shirts throughout the month, so stay tuned.

My draft pull requests don’t seem to be counting toward Hacktoberfest. What’s going on?
For Hacktoberfest, pull requests on GitHub will not be counted until they are marked as ready for review: those marked as draft will not be counted. Please make sure to mark any draft pull requests as ready for review so that project maintainers can merge them.

How can I exclude my repository from Hacktoberfest?
We’ve changed the program to only count pull requests that are made to repositories with a hacktoberfest topic or labeled with hacktoberfest-accepted. Due to this change, it’s no longer necessary for maintainers to opt out of Hacktoberfest.

What happens if I make a pull request before the maintainer adds a hacktoberfest topic to the repository?
Your pull request will undergo a review period in which the repository will be checked for the Hacktoberfest topic or has a hacktoberfest-accepted label on it. We will continue to check this pull request and repository until November 1 for the hacktoberfest topic. If the topic is added to the repository, the pull request will become valid.

What happens if I complete fewer than four pull requests by the end of the month?
Unfortunately, you will have to submit at least four pull requests to receive a prize.

My PR was labeled as invalid, but it isn’t. What should I do?
If a maintainer labels your pull request as invalid or spam, but you don’t believe this is correct, please begin a conversation with the maintainer within the PR and explain your position.

Why isn’t my pull request counted?
If the maintainer has marked your pull request as invalid, or you have contributed to a repository that isn’t classified with a Hacktoberfest topic, your pull request will not count toward the challenge. Your pull requests will only count toward your participation if they are in a repository with the hacktoberfest topic and once they have been merged, approved by a maintainer or labeled as hacktoberfest-accepted. Additionally, any pull request with the hacktoberfest-accepted label, submitted to any public GitHub repository, with or without the hacktoberfest topic, will be considered valid for Hacktoberfest.
